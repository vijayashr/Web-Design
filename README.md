# Web Design
This project was completed using HTML5 and Cascading Styling Sheets.
The JavaJam project navigated through the principles of Website organization,
Styling the website with the Inline/Embedded cascading styles, visual elements and Graphics.
Learned how to make the website compatible to view on a tablet and the
mobile phone using Viewport Meta Tag and CSS Mobile queries. Created Forms 
using HTML5 Form Controls and also created an E-Commerce page. 
Lastly used JavaScript and jQuery to show when the page was last modified
and to create an alert when the mouse hovered on a link in the web page.
